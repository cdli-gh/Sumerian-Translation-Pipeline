## Usage
Clone the Repo https://github.com/cdli-gh/Sumerian-Translation-Pipeline.git \
Install requirments and Download weights for the Machine Translation model \
Run pipeline.py file with the ATF/txt input file, the results will be in ATF_OUTPUT folder \
If you are using text file as input rather than ATF, set atf argument as False, the CDLI-conll files and atf output will not be generated in that case  
```
git clone https://github.com/cdli-gh/Sumerian-Translation-Pipeline.git
```
```
cd Sumerian-Translation-Pipeline
```
```
pip3 install `cat requirments.txt`
```
```
wget https://cdlisumerianunmt.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/BackTranslation/5st/_step_10000.pt -O Translation_Models/Back_Translation.pt
```
```
python3 pipeline.py -i ATF_INPUT/demo.atf -o ATF_OUTPUT/
```
Backtranslation Model is set as default, to download other weights please check [Translation_Models](https://github.com/cdli-gh/Sumerian-Translation-Pipeline/tree/master/Translation_Models) Repository

\(If working on conda Environment install pytorch seperately to run Machine Translation models - conda install pytorch \)

## Pipeline
Run Sumerian Translation Pipeline to extract information about Sumerian Text using POS, NER and Machine Translation. Since some of the weights are already saved, so these models can be used directly without training.    
```

## POS and NER MODELS

### Training
#### 1 Hidden Markov Model (POS_HMM)
No need to train. To evaluate/run use HMM.py. It calculates probability without saving weights.
```
$ Python3 POS_Models/POS_HMM/training.py
  -i INPUT,     Location of the Input training file in the specific
                format (csv file with columns ID FORM XPOSTAG)
```
#### 2. Conditional Random Field (CRF_Model)
Uses Sumerian Features, can be modified with the subject knowledge. Weights of CRF models are saved in Saved_Model. There are different files for sumerian POS features and sumerian NER features
```
$ Python3 {POS_Models/NER_Models}/{POS_CRF/NER_CRF}/training.py
  -i INPUT,      Location of the Input training file in the specific
                 format (csv file with columns ID FORM XPOSTAG/NER)
  -o OUTPUT,     Location of the model weights to be saved
```
#### 3. Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network (Bi_LSTM_Model)
Deep learning model, used word2vec/fasttext word-embeddings, weights are saved in .h5 format in Saved_Model.  
```
$ Python3 {POS_Models/NER_Models}/POS_Bi_LSTM/training.py
  -i INPUT,      Location of the Input training file in the specific
                 format (csv file with columns ID FORM XPOSTAG)
  -e EMBEDDING,  Location of sumerian word embeddings
  -o OUTPUT,     Location of model weights to be saved
```
#### 4. Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network CRF (Bi_LSTM_CRF_Model)
Integrated Deep learning and conditional random field model, uses word2vec/fasttext word-embeddings, weights are saved in .h5 format in Saved_Model. 
```
$ Python3 {POS_Models/NER_Models}/{POS_Bi_LSTM_CRF/NER_Bi_LSTM_CRF}/training.py
  -i INPUT,      Location of the Input training file in the specific
                 format (csv file with columns ID FORM XPOSTAG)
  -e EMBEDDING,  Location of sumerian word embeddings
  -o OUTPUT,     Location of model weights to be saved
```


### Predictions
Since weights are saved, we can use all models directly for predictions.   
```
$ Python3 {POS_Models/NER_Models}/{Choice from the above models}/prediction.py
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Location of the Input text file to be predicted
  -s SAVED, --saved SAVED
                        Location of saved weights in .pkl or .h5 format
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Location of output text file(Result)

Any Model can be used for the predictions for any txt file. Here we used Dataset/sumerian_demo.txt as input file. which contains 150 random sentences from 1.5M sumerian text.
```


## FLAIR
Flair is very simple framework for state-of-the-art NLP, It allows you to apply our state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models to your text, such as named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech tagging (PoS). It is currently the best state of art technique to tag POS and NER for English langauge. I used this to train forward and backword language models and applied with different combination of Word Wmbeddings. For further references follow - https://github.com/flairNLP/flair

All the corpus folders to train language model, fine tune POS and NER are in FLAIR repository in the desired format. The below code can be used, and modified if needed for traing and fine tunning - 
```
# foward language model
python3 FLAIR/flair_forward_LanguageModel.py

# backward language model
python3 FLAIR/flair_backward_LanguageModel.py

# FineTunning POS
python3 FLAIR/flair_POS_trainer.py

# FineTunning NER
python3 FLAIR/flair_NER_trainer.py

# To predict (Default is POS)
python3 FLAIR/predict.py
```
To use Differnt word Embeddings such as Glove, Fasttext, Word2vec along with backword and forward language model Embeddins, First convert the text wordvectors file to gensim format using the below code (for word2vec). Follow this link for further details - [CLASSIC_WORD_EMBEDDINGS](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/embeddings/CLASSIC_WORD_EMBEDDINGS.md) 
```
import gensim

word_vectors = gensim.models.KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('/path/to/fasttext/embeddings.txt', binary=False)
word_vectors.save('/path/to/converted')
```
I used the following stack of Embeddings - character_embeddings, word2vec, forward_flair, backword_flair. The transfrmer embeddings can also be used, BERT model is described below. 


## BERT

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a recent paper published by researchers at Google AI Language. It has caused a stir in the Machine Learning community by presenting state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of NLP tasks. I used RoBERTo (by Facebook) as an experiment but any transformer model can be used for training and fine-tunning the language model. For training the language model sumerian_monolingual_processed data is used, and for fine-tunning similar data is used as for the FLAIR models. To train and finetune I  used [HuggingFace framework](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)  \
To train Language model simpaly use -

```
python3 BERT/language_model_train.py 
```

The language model training is very time consuming so it is advised to use GPUs for training perposes, Google colab notebook can also be used for free GPU access. \
To do the fine tunning for any token classification task (POS and NER is our case) the similar script can be used as provided, we just need a tokenizer and language model accordingly. To fine tune the BERT Model use - 
```
cd BERT/
sh fine_tune.sh
```
For further details please follow the documentation - [https://huggingface.co/transformers/examples.html](https://huggingface.co/transformers/examples.html)



### Word_Embeddings
All Word Embedding models are Trained on Sumerian Processed Monolingual Dataset(contain around 1.5M UrIII phrases). The trained word embeddings are also used in Flair Language models
#### Word2vec 
Word2vec model can be trained using Word2vec_train.py file in Word_Embeddings Repo.
To train use - 
```
Python3 Word2vec_train.py -input CDLI_Data/Sumerian_monolingual_processed.txt -output Word_Embeddings/sumerian_word2vec_50.txt 
```
The used model is trained with \
  model = Word2Vec(Monolingual_Text, size=50, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4) \
which can be changed according to the requirments, by simply updating the Word2vec_train.py file  

#### Glove
To train glove wordVectors clone (https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe) \
remove lines 1-15 in demo.sh file and update the required fields, to get the similar results use -
```
CORPUS=Sumerian_monolingual_processed.txt 
VOCAB_FILE=vocab.txt 
COOCCURRENCE_FILE=cooccurrence.bin 
COOCCURRENCE_SHUF_FILE=cooccurrence.shuf.bin 
BUILDDIR=build 
SAVE_FILE=vectors 
VERBOSE=2 
MEMORY=4.0 
VOCAB_MIN_COUNT=1 
VECTOR_SIZE=50 
MAX_ITER=100 
WINDOW_SIZE=15 
BINARY=2 
NUM_THREADS=8 
X_MAX=10 
```
Run shell script \
```
sh demo.sh
```

#### Fasttext
To train fasttext word embeddings install the library -
```
$ pip3 install fastext
```
and run -
```
import fasttext
model = fasttext.train_unsupervised('CDLI_Data/Sumerian_monolingual_processed.txt', model='skipgram',dim=50,epoch=50,minCount=1,minn=2,maxn=15)
model.save_model("Word_Embeddings/fasttext50.txt")
```
